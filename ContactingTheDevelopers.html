<h2>Contacting the developers</h2>
<p>If you have any comments or suggestions, the first place to go is the AGS Forums. Linked off the main AGS website, it's where the AGS community meets and you will find answers to many questions there.</p>
<p>If you think you've found a bug, if you need help or can't get it to work, please check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>That your question is not already answered in this manual. AGS has been painstakingly documented, so PLEASE read this manual through before asking a question.</li>
<li>Search the Adventure Game Studio Forums to see if someone already asked the question there. You can use either the <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?action=search2">built-in search</a> or Google.</li>
<li>If it is not covered in the manual, check the CHANGES.TXT file. If a new feature has been added then it will be described there, if it has not yet been added to this manual.</li>
<li>That you are using the most recent version of AGS. Use the "Check For Updates" option on the Help menu to make sure you're up to date.</li>
<li>If you are receiving an error message, please write down the EXACT message and any other information which you think is appropriate. PLEASE WRITE THE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE TEXT, don't just say "I get a message about it not being able to find a file".</li>
<li>If you are getting lock-ups or techno-garbage printouts, please try to give a situation which causes the problem. For instance, if you notice that it only happens on certain screens, or only if there is an object, etc then please state that - it makes replying a lot easier and faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the problem, if you can't solve it then post to the Technical Forums for help and include all the details of the problem -- there are lots of people there who will try to help you out.</p>
<p>Please don't send us e-mails or private messages about problems using AGS. Post them to the forums, where others can help you and your question will then be searchable so that people in future can find out the answer without having to ask again!</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> If you want to provide your game as an attachment to demonstrate a problem you are having, PLEASE COMPRESS IT using WinZip, PKZIP, etc and send it as a zip file.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> When you post a question to the forums, give it at least 24 hours before posting again asking "WHY IS NOBODY HELPING ME?!?!?". We don't all read the forums 24/7, good things come to those who wait.</p>
