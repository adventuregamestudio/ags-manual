<h2>Upgrading to AGS 2.71</h2>
<p>AGS 2.71 adds new simple string support to the scripting language. Strings have long been a pain to use in AGS, but this is finally addressed by v2.71.</p>
<p>There's a new String type (that's a capital 'S'). These new strings behave like Java/<code>C#</code> strings in that you can easily assign to and manipulate them.</p>
<p>For example, in 2.7 and previous versions, you had to do this:</p>
<pre><code>string text;
StrCopy(text, &quot;This is my text&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>in 2.71, you can now do:</p>
<pre><code>String text = &quot;This is my text&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, the == and != operators can be used to compare strings for equality (equivalent to using StrComp but much more intuitive). An additional benefit is that there is no longer a need for GetText() and SetText() methods -- instead, we can now just have Text properties.</p>
<p>All the old-style functions that took a "string buffer" parameter have now been replaced with new ones that return a string instead. Where properties have been created, you should be able to use them like any other property, so:</p>
<pre><code>lblLabel.Text = &quot;Hello&quot;;
String buttonValue = btnOK.Text;
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some of the new functions are provided on the Game object -- for example, the new GetSaveSlotDescription function needs to be called like this:<br> <code>String description = Game.GetSaveSlotDescription(10);</code><br> This is part of a move towards all built-in functions being object-based, but watch out for it as it could well cause some confusion. The manual will show you which functions require this.</p>
<p>Rather than using old functions like StrCat and StrContains, you now call the functions directly on the strings:</p>
<pre><code>String text = &quot;Hello&quot;;
text = text.Append(&quot;World&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>will mean that <em>text</em> now contains "HelloWorld".<br> Note the <strong>text =</strong> in that expression. Functions like Append will return a modified version of the string, they won't actually change the original. Therefore, to update the <em>text</em> variable you need to assign the result to it.</p>
<p><strong>Backwards compatibility</strong></p>
<p>In order to maintain backwards compatibility, a new "const" keyword has been added. This applies only to old-style strings, and allows them to interoperate with the new ones. A new-style String can be passed to a function that expects a "const string" (which means that it will not be allowed to change the string's contents), but cannot be passed to a function that expects a "string" (since it could overwrite the string data and mess things up).</p>
<p>So, you may find that any custom functions you have that take a string parameter stop working. If this is the case, change the parameter from "string" to "const string" and that should fix it.</p>
<p>Apologies for the inconvenience, but this is the only way to allow new Strings to interoperate safely with old-style strings.</p>
