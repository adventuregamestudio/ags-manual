# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to AGS Manual wiki. The AGS Manual is 
made better by people like you.

Since the manual is made by multiple contributions, reading the guidelines
ensure we can provide a cohesive document for the game developers using AGS.
We also assume you are also a game developer using AGS which means the future
you will also be thanking yourself later.

*If instead you have questions about building the manual and website help 
template, create an issue on GitHub so we can discuss that!*

## About opening issues

- Be respectful when writing issues
- If you want to discuss a topic already on the manual, link it in the wiki.
- If you want to discuss a new entry, not in the manual, suggest it's name and
where it would reside
- Issues is where we can sketch ideas and discuss pages, so don't be afraid of
writing too much, just be aware that it will take more time to think about the 
more is written.

## About writing in the wiki

- Ensure all pages have at least one other page that leads to it, do not break
or have orphanated pages.

### How to add screenshots to the documentation

Screenshots should be avoided, but they make sense in tutorials or when
describing how AGS Editor user interface works.

- Do not overuse screenshots. 
- Screenshots should be saved as PNG or JPG, with a width of at least 400 px. 
- Try to keep file size less than 220KB.
- Do not rely on images to provide information or context.
- Do not include any personally identifying information.
- Capture just the part of the screen or window that users must focus on.
- Do not include window headers in the final screenshots unless completely necessary.
- Limit empty GUI space, manipulate your screenshots to condense important information.
- Do not include any watermark or any reference to other tools in a screenshot.
- Prefer the interface and portrayed game objects to be in English when possible.

### About code snipets in contributions

Always ensure your code snippets in the manual follow below

- Is as small as possible to achieve what's desired;
- Either can run on empty game template or can run on Sierra template;
- If it requires additional resources (like a gMyGUI, cEgo2, ...) it can be 
graped from the context it's presented.

## Getting started

- Create an account on GitHub
- If you are unsure about your contribution, Create an issue
- If you are REALLY confident about your contribution, and you have created at
least one issue, write in the wiki
