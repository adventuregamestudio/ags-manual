<h2><a href="#upgrading-to-ags-31">Upgrading to AGS 3.1</a></h2>
<p>AGS 3.1 contains some major changes over previous versions. The main change is support for native hi-res co-ordinates.</p>
<p><strong>What are native hi-res co-ordinates?</strong></p>
<p>In previous versions of AGS, everything in the game was addressed in co-ordinates ranging from 0-319 for X values, and 0-199 (or 239) for Y values.</p>
<p>This made sense if your game was 320x200 or 320x240, but if your game was running at 640x480 or 800x600 this was a pain because you couldn't think in the co-ordinate system that your game was written for.</p>
<p><strong>Why was it like this?</strong></p>
<p>When AGS was originally written it only supported 320x200, and extra resolutions were then "bolted-on" on top later. But the fundamental co-ordinate system underneath was never changed. This had the advantage that Setup could provide the option to run a 320x200 game at 640x400 or vice versa, since it didn't make any difference to the way the game would run internally.</p>
<p><strong>Why change it?</strong></p>
<p>One of the main problems with the 320x200 co-ordinate system was that if you were making a 640x480 game, you could only ever place objects and characters on even co-ordinates. Aligning the objects with the background properly could be a pain and involved adding an extra column of transparent pixels to the sprite to get it to line up properly.</p>
<p>Originally this was judged to be a minor annoyance, but over time as more and more people have started making hi-res games it has become a major limitation of AGS.</p>
<p><strong>What has changed?</strong></p>
<p>If your game is 320x200 or 320x240, you will not notice any difference. Everything should continue working the same way as before.</p>
<p>However, if your game is 640x400 or higher then the first thing you will notice when importing your game into AGS 3.1 is that all the co-ordinates in the editor will double. From now on, the editor will <strong>always</strong> display native hi-res co-ordinates.</p>
<p>In your scripts though, you've probably got loads of commands like <em>player.Walk</em> where you pass in specific low-res co-ordinates. By default, AGS will import your game in backwards-compatible mode, where your scripts continue to work as before. This means that all script commands and properties will continue to accept and return low-res co-ordinates. It also means that the limitations of placing objects on even pixels remains.</p>
<p>If you want to enable the new native hi-res co-ordinate support, there is an option in the Scripting section of the General Settings pane called "Use low-res co-ordinates in script". If you turn this off, AGS will expect native resolution co-ordinates to be used in your script.</p>
<p>Obviously converting all your scripts to use hi-res co-ordinates would be a mammoth task, so you may well decide to continue using low-res co-ordinates for your current game, and then start your next game with native hi-res co-ordinates. It's up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Setup has changed, I can't select the resolution any more!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as part of the support for native co-ordinates, you are no longer able to run a 320x200 game at 640x400, or vice versa.</p>
<p>If you are developing a 320x200 game and were using the 640x400 setting to enlarge the window, you can enable the 2x or 3x graphics filter in Setup instead, which provides a similar result.</p>
